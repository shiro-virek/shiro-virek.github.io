This is my creative coding playground 🧪⚗️

My goal is primarily to learn about graphic techniques, creative coding, and generative art, using only vanilla JavaScript.

By default, a random scene is selected 🎲 

To select a particular scene, pass the scene name into the "art" parameter.

Example: index.html/?art=skyscrapers

You can see them in action at https://eapelroso.com 🙃
