# eapelroso-lab

Here I put most of my creative coding experiments.

By default, a random scene is triggered 🎲 

To select a particular scene, pass the scene name into the "art" parameter.

Example: index.html/?art=city

Scenes currently available:

- blurry
- city
- confetti
- fire
- metro
- rotators
- tentacle

You can see them in action at https://eapelroso.com 🙃
